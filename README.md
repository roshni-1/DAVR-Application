# DAVR-Application
An application for automatically analyzing, visualizing and generating reports of the uploaded file. File formats Supported are csv, txt, pdf. 

Features: File upload, detecting outliers, missing values, descriptive statistics, predective modelling, tokenization and stopword removal, word frequency analysis, extracting keywords, names entity recognition(NER), Topic Modelling(LDA), Sentiment analysis etc  

# Application development under process !! Stay tunned
To create an application that can  perform various types of analysis on any type of file and format, we'll need to implement a wide range of functionalities. Here's a comprehensive list of features we can include in the backend:

File Type Detection: Determine the type of file uploaded by the user (e.g., CSV, TXT, PDF, Excel, etc.).
Descriptive Analysis:
Basic statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, etc.).
EDA
Time series analysis (if applicable  on the data)
prescriptive analysis
casual analysis
Histograms, box plots, pie charts, pair plots, line chart, area chart, column chart, bubble chart etc and other visualizations for numerical data.
Frequency distributions, word clouds, and other visualizations for text data.
Outlier detection and handling.
Correlation analysis between variables.
Predictive Analysis:
Regression analysis for continuous target variables.
Classification analysis for categorical target variables.
Decision tree modeling for both regression and classification.
Gradient boosting modeling for both regression and classification.
Model evaluation metrics (e.g., MSE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Text Analysis:
Word frequency analysis.
Text summarization.
Sentiment analysis.
Named entity recognition (NER).
Topic modeling (e.g., LDA).
Keyword extraction.
PDF Analysis:
Text extraction from PDF files.
Basic text analysis (e.g., word frequency, summarization).
Handling Missing Values:
Identify missing values in the dataset.
Imputation strategies (e.g., mean, median, mode, forward fill, backward fill, interpolation).
Advanced Visualization:
Support for various types of charts (e.g., line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, heatmap, etc.).
2D and 3D visualizations.
Interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly.
Error Handling:
Handle errors gracefully during file upload, analysis, and visualization.
Provide informative error messages to the user.
Efficiency and Scalability:
Optimize code for performance to handle large datasets efficiently.
Ensure scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.
